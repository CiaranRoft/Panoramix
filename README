Description : 	A python application that can analyse WAV files. It can extract the data nessesary to extract the amplitudes values for each sample,
	      	That can then be plotted as a waveform, Using these amplitude values Panoramix can then extract the data nessesary to plot a spectrogram
	      	of all the the frequencies contained within the WAV file.

		There are methods within the Panoramix application that allow the user to send either amplitude values or frequncy values to 
		be represented of an LED matrix controlled by an Arduino. The code uploaded to the Arduino is an Arduino library writen specifically 
		for the Panoramix application
	

Arduino Libraries Used: 

light_WS2812B : Used to control the LEDS
Mrtix : Specifically written to control the Panoramix LED matrix

Installed Python Libraries :

pylab - For plotting waveform and spectrogram
numpy - For datastructures and calculations
alsaaudio - Used to play WAV file

Instructions for use:

First all of the extrnal libraries for python have to be installed, and the folder called matrix that has the
matrix header file and cpp file inside has to be placed in the Arduino library folder. This creates the Arduino library 
used to control the LED matrix.

Then simply open the python idle IDE and open up Panoramix.p, rename the beat string to the name of the WAV file to be analyzed. 
Once the waveform and Spectrogram are displayed the Panoramix application waits untill this window is closed before continuing to 
generate commands, send thoes commands to the Arduino, and play the WAV file. And let Panoramix handle the rest
